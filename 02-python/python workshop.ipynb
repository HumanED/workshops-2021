    "In order to start making a computer program do more than simple pre-determined calculations we have to introduce the idea of conditional statements. These make the execution path though the code depend on the values of the variables. This is called Flow Control and is the first real step in programming. \n",

    "\n",

    "if condition:\n",
    "    code\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "where condition is an expression that evaluates to a boolean (either true or false). If the condition is false then code is not executed (those line are ignored), while if the condition is true then code is executed.\n",
    "If statements are usually used in combination of else statements:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "    code\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    other_code\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this case the first part is exaclty the same as before, if the condition is false it won't execute code and it it is true it will; however other_code will only be executed if code is not executed. Basically if the condition is not true, then Python won't go inside the if statement but will go into the else statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some times we want to check for multiple conditions we can do:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if condition_one and condition_two:\n",

    "else:\n",
    "    other_code\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe we want to do different things for different conditions, then we have two possibilities: either we want to check each condition independently and do one thing for each condition (example 1), or we want only to check the different conditionals if the one before hasn't been met (example 2):\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",

    "if condition_one:\n",

    "    code_three\n",
    "if condition_four:\n",
    "    code_four\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this case, python will check condition_one, if it is met it will execute code_one, and if it is not met it will not execute code_one. Then, independenlty of the evaluation of condition_one, it will check condition two and if it's met then it will execute code_two and so on for the different if's. Note that each if statement could be accompanied with an else statement that executes some code_i if condition_i is not met.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2:\n",

    "elif condition_three:\n",

    "elif condition_four:\n",
    "    code_four\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    code_five\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this case python will check if condition_one is True or False, if it is true then it will execute code_one and that's it, it will not execute any other code_i no matter if condition_i is true. However, if condition_one is not true it will check condition_two and if it is true then it will execute code_two and that's it. This will go on until it finds some condition that is true or until it reaches the else statement (it will run code_five if and only if all the previous conditions have not been met). Note that if the else statement was omited, the code will just go on if none of the conditions are met. Also, note that you cannot include an else statement associated to an elif statement.

Note that the resulting list is a different datatype than the lists we have previously encontered. You can convert ```range(a,b)``` to a traditional list as follows ```list(range(a,b))```. Finally, if you wanted to iterate over numbers: $a, a + 2, a + 4, ..., b-1$, you could simply use ```range(a,b, 2)```."
