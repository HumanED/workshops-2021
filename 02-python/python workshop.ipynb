    "    other_code\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this case the first part is exaclty the same as before, if the condition is false it won't execute code and it it is true it will, however other_code will be only executed if code is not executed.

This will go on until it finds some condition that is true or until it reaches the else statement (it will run code_five if and only if all the previous conditions have not been met). Note that the else statement could not be there, in that case the code will just go on if no of the conditions is met. Also, Note that you cannot include an else per elif statement.
