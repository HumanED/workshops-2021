However, if condition_one is not true it will check condition_two and if it is true then it will execute code_two and that's it. This will go on until it finds some condition that is true or until it reaches the else statement (it will run code_five if and only if all the previous conditions have not been met). Note that if the else statement was omited, the code will just go on if none of the conditions are met. Also, note that you cannot include an else statement associated to an elif statement.

    "# 4. For Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "The For Loop is a control flow statement used to iterate over lists (or other kinds of sequences). The general structure of a for loop is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = [1,2,3,4,5]\n",
    "for i in x:\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "When this code is executed, each element in ```x``` would be printed to the console. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since strings are also sequence data types, we can use a for loop to iterate over Strings:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_string = 'HumanEd is awesome'\n",
    "for c in my_string:\n",
    "    print(c)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code iterates over every character in ```my_string```, printing the character.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the ```break``` statement to exit out of a for loop when a particular condition is met:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = [178, 34, 12, 98, 21, 45, 87]\n",
    "for i in x:\n",
    "    if (i%7 == 0):\n",
    "        print(i)\n",
    "        break\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code iterates over the elements in ```x``` to find the first element that is divisible by 7. Once this element is found, we exit the for loop. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we can use the ```continue``` statement to skip to the next loop iteration:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]\n",
    "for i in x:\n",
    "    if (i%2 == 0):\n",
    "        continue\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code would print all the odd elements of x, skipping the even ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it is often useful to iterate over a large quantity of consecutive numbers. This can easily be achieved using the ```range()``` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(1000):\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code prints every number from 0 to 999. Internally, ```range(a,b)``` constructs a list of consicutive numbers from a to b - 1, where could be omited and it will be assumed that ```a=0```. Note that the resulting list is a different datatype than the lists we have previously encontered. You can convert ```range(a,b)``` to a traditional list as follows ```list(range(a,b))```. Finally, if you wanted to iterate over numbers: $a, a + 2, a + 4, ..., b-1$, you could simply use ```range(a,b, 2)```."
