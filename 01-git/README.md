# Git Workshop
Welcome to the git workshop, you will learn how to use git (particularly how to use github) to work with your peers in different projects.
The first part is to make sure that git is installed in your machine.
```console
foo@bar:foo~$ git
```
If this command gives an error then it means that it has not been recognised by your terminal, therefore you have to install git.
